Originally Catalog.java was quite hard to implement. Most this project was even more difficult due to my prior background in C++ and not in Java, but once I realized the similarities it was a lot easier. Catalog became much easier to implement once I started using a Map between each key and table; by using Map, it provided a natural way to access everything with the Tables that I needed to.

A more challenging problem with this project was having to implement an iterator over the DbFileIterator. Conceptually I had a hard time understanding interfaces and 'implements', but once I understood it and how it worked the entire thing became easier. By making an entire new class that implements a Heap File iterator over the Database File iterator, that portion of lab 1 became more clear after that.
